# Coding Practice  

## Overview  
This repository contains materials and exercises for the *Coding Practice* course, focusing on hands-on programming techniques.  

## lab1 - Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
In the first lab, we practiced Test-Driven Development (TDD) through the *Kata String Calculator* exercise. Working in pairs, we incrementally developed the `cal(numbers)` function by writing unit tests first and then implementing the code.

## lab2 - Pair Programming (Game of Life)
In this lab, we practiced Pair Programming by implementing Conway's Game of Life. Working in rotating driver-navigator roles, we focused on clean code, collaboration, and shared understanding of the task.

## lab3 - Code Reviews and Refactoring (Tennis Game)
In this lab, the focus is on practical code reviews and refactoring techniques. The task involves improving an existing Python implementation of a tennis scoring system. The goal is to enhance code quality by refactoring methods.
