# lab1_tdd - Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview  
In this lab, we worked in pairs to implement the *Kata String Calculator* using Test-Driven Development (TDD). Each step was completed in about 10 minutes, with computer swaps after each task.

## Steps  
1. Wrote unit tests for the `cal(numbers)` function, initially handling up to two comma-separated numbers.  
2. Implemented the function based on the tests.  
3. Extended the tests and implementation to support multiple numbers.  
4. Modified the tests and code to allow newline characters (`\n`) as delimiters.
