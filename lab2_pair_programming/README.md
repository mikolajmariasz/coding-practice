# lab2_pair-programming - Game of Life

## Overview
In this lab, we implemented Conway’s Game of Life using the Pair Programming technique.  
The task was completed in pairs, with role switching every 10 minutes — one person acted as the **driver** (writing code), and the other as the **navigator** (reviewing and guiding the implementation). The project was developed in Python as a console application.

## Steps

- Designed a 2D grid to represent the game board.
- Represented each cell as either **alive** or **dead**.
- Implemented the rules of the Game of Life:
  - A **live cell** with **2 or 3** live neighbors stays alive.
  - A **dead cell** with **exactly 3** live neighbors becomes alive.
  - All other cells become or remain dead.
- Initialized the board with a random set of live cells.
- Updated the board state every second to simulate time steps.
- Used console output to visualize each generation of the simulation.
- Reflected on the effectiveness of the Pair Programming technique during a final retrospective.

## Key Takeaways

- Improved collaboration and communication skills.
- Gained practical experience with role switching and teamwork.
- Practiced clean code principles and modular design under time constraints.
